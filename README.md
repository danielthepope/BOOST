BOOST
=====

CM30229 Coursework 1, by David Paris and Daniel Pope

For best behaviour, load Experiment 3 to the NXT brick and start Boost parallel to a wall. Or, compile the code with EXPERIMENT_NUMBER set to 0. Boost will try to align with a nearby wall by itself.

Boost's abilities are shown in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g2T9t8D5WQ
